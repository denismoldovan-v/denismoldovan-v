# 👨‍💻 Denys Moldovan

🎓 I'm a cybersecurity student at **Warsaw University of Technology**, currently in my **4th semester**. I enjoy working close to the metal — whether it's backend development, system-level analysis, or FPGA design.  

At university, I’m involved in practical cybersecurity labs, signal processing, and networking exercises — working with protocols like **BGP**, **RIP**, **SNMP**, and network emulation tools like **Mininet**. I combine that knowledge with hands-on projects in both software and hardware.

## 🧪 Featured Projects

### 🛡️ DDoS Detector on FPGA
Verilog-based system for detecting abnormal traffic bursts. Uses CRC hashing, frequency thresholds, and signal analysis. Testbench simulation + waveform tracing via GTKWave. Python model also included.

### 📦 Spring Boot Sports Club Platform
RESTful backend with real-time logic, authentication, and database persistence. Used in backend training for CRUD operations on coaches and sessions.

### ♟️ Chess App
Network-ready Java chess with save/load, GUI (Swing), and AI logic. Built as a side project to explore OOP + game state architecture.

### 📊 Network Emulation & Testing with Mininet
Designed virtual topologies with multiple hosts and switches. Configured delays, bandwidth, queue sizes, and ran tests using `iperf`, `pingall`, and HTTP server clients. Explored routing behavior and packet loss under stress.

### ✉️ Email Classifier (GPT-based)
Python script using OpenAI’s GPT to intelligently sort incoming JSON-based emails into relevant folders. Smart automation meets actual usefulness.

## 🎯 Interests & Focus Areas

- Cybersecurity (network protocols, OSINT, detection strategies)  
- Digital systems and embedded logic  
- Backend services, APIs, and automation  
- Legal aspects of cybersecurity, monetary policy & economics  
- Tools that reduce friction and expose what’s under the hood

---

## 🧠 Personal Philosophy

- I believe **security should be engineered, not patched**.  
- I enjoy debugging logic and signals more than most.  
- I treat tools like `dumpvars` and `iperf` as everyday essentials.  
- If I don’t understand how it works, I dig until I do.
